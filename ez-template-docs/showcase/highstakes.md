Hearing about common issues teams were having attempting to exit movements faster, the bugs were squashed and "motion chaining" became officially supported in [v3.1.0](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template/releases/tag/v3.1.0).  Soon after, v3.2.0 came out which is the biggest update to EZ-Template ever: odometry!  This raises the ceiling of what can be accomplished with EZ-Template immensely.
